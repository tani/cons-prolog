## Definitions and queries

```lisp
(<-- (append () ?ys ?ys))
(<- (append (?x . ?xs) ?ys (?x . ?zs))
    (append ?xs ?ys ?zs))
(?- (append ?xs ?ys (a b c)))
```

`<--` replaces all clauses of the same name and arity; `<-` appends one.
Ordinary predicates select goals left to right and clauses in definition order,
using depth-first search. Tabled predicates use SLG.

Symbols beginning with `?` are logic variables. Each occurrence of `?` is a
fresh anonymous variable. Common Lisp package identity matters for symbols.
`?-` returns all solutions as binding alists: failure is NIL, while a successful
goal without named bindings returns `(NIL)`. Use limits or cursors for large or
infinite answer sets.

```lisp
(query '((append ?xs ?ys (a b c))) :limit 2)
(let ((cursor (make-query '((append ?xs ?ys (a b c))))))
  (unwind-protect
      (loop
        (multiple-value-bind (solution foundp) (next-solution cursor)
          (unless foundp (return))
          (print solution)))
    (close-query cursor)))
```

The second value of `next-solution` distinguishes an answer from exhaustion.
Answer cons graphs are copied and remain valid after backtracking. Unbound
variables become fresh `?G...` symbols, preserving sharing within each answer.

Bind `*database*` to a `make-database` result to isolate definitions.
`clear-database` removes clauses and table declarations. Databases are intended
for single-threaded use; synchronization is not implemented.

## Terms

Terms are native Lisp cons graphs. Lists and compound terms are not distinct.

```lisp
(?- (= ?x (f a b)))
(?- (= ?x (a b c)))
(?- (= (a . ?tail) (a b))) ; ?tail = (b)
```

`list`, `cons` and `:compound` have no special constructor meaning.
`(f)` is a one-element list in data position and an `f/0` call in goal position.
Input terms, answers and callback values use the same representation.

Unification uses rational trees by default, without an occurs check; shared and
cyclic cons graphs are supported in ordinary execution. Atomic comparisons use
EQL, so distinct strings are not unified by their contents. Set `*print-circle*`
to T when printing cyclic answers. See [Builtins](BUILTINS.md) for explicit
occurs-check unification and term inspection.

Unknown predicates raise an existence error by default; the `unknown` flag can
select failure instead. Builtins cannot be overwritten.

## Lisp callbacks

```lisp
(let ((items '(a b c)) (results nil))
  (prolog
    (lisp ?items items)
    (append ?xs ?ys ?items)
    (lisp (push (list ?xs ?ys) results)))
  (nreverse results))
```

- `(lisp ?output expression)` unifies the expression's result with the output.
- `(lisp expression)` evaluates the expression and succeeds regardless of its value.
- `(lispp expression)` succeeds when the expression returns a true Lisp value.
- `prolog` enumerates answers and normally returns NIL.

Callbacks capture their lexical environment, including in clause definitions.
Their logic-variable inputs are copied Lisp data; use ground inputs. There is no
host API for manipulating unbound logic variables. Symbols beginning with `?`
are detected as callback variables even inside quoted expressions.
Lisp side effects are not undone by backtracking.

`return-from prolog` and Lisp exceptions release the VM through host
`unwind-protect`. A Prolog cleanup construct spanning backtracking is not
implemented. Interactive Allegro-style queries and its variable APIs are also
not implemented.

## DCGs

`-->` appends a grammar clause; `--->` replaces clauses of the same grammar name
and arity. Expansion adds input and remainder arguments to each nonterminal,
then compiles the result with the ordinary WAM backend.

```lisp
(---> (article) '(the))
(---> (noun cat) '(cat))
(--> (noun dog) '(dog))
(---> (sentence ?noun) (article) (noun ?noun))

(?- (phrase (sentence ?noun) (the cat)))
;; => (((?noun . cat)))
(?- (phrase (sentence ?noun) ?tokens))
;; => (((?noun . cat) (?tokens the cat))
;;     ((?noun . dog) (?tokens the dog)))
(?- (phrase (sentence ?noun) (the dog extra) ?rest))
;; => (((?noun . dog) (?rest extra)))
```

| Grammar form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `(noun ?x)` or `noun` | Nonterminal call |
| `'(a b ?x)` | Token sequence; variables and compound tokens unify |
| `'()`, `(and)`, or an empty rule body | Empty sequence |
| Consecutive body forms or `(and A B ...)` | Sequence |
| `(or A B ...)` | Ordered alternatives; wrap multi-form branches in `and` |
| `(do G1 G2 ...)` | Ordinary goals without consuming input |
| `!` or `(!)` | Cut within the current grammar predicate |

`quote`, `and`, `or` and `do` are reserved DCG body syntax. Quote marks a token
sequence rather than making its variables constant. The sequence must be a
finite proper list; individual tokens may be arbitrary Lisp terms.

```lisp
(let ((offset 10))
  (---> (adjusted ?out)
    '(?n)
    (do (lispp (integerp ?n))
        (lisp ?out (+ ?n offset)))))
(?- (phrase (adjusted ?out) (3))) ; => (((?out . 13)))
```

`phrase/2` requires complete input consumption; `phrase/3` exposes the remainder.
Its grammar argument may be a nonterminal or an inline grammar expression.
Generated variables are hygienic and omitted from answer alists. Inline phrase
expressions have their own cut boundary and preserve caller alternatives.

The Lisp function `phrase` accepts runtime grammar data:

```lisp
(phrase '(sentence ?noun) '(the cat))
(phrase '(sentence ?noun) '?tokens nil :limit 1 :gc-threshold 64)
(phrase ''(the cat) '(the cat)) ; Pass (quote (the cat)) as grammar data.
```

Supply the optional remainder before keyword arguments. For lexical callbacks,
use definition macros, `?-` or `prolog`. Streaming queries use `make-query` with
`((phrase ...))` goals. `dcg-expand` returns the expanded head and body as two values.

Legacy `:terminals`, `:seq`, `:or`, `:goal` and `:goals` forms remain accepted.
Alternatives execute within a shared environment, so prefix side effects run
once rather than once per branch. Saved branch environments are GC roots.

Dynamic nonterminal calls, semicontext/push-back and grammar-level negation or
conditionals are unsupported. Strings are not automatically converted to
character/code sequences. Untabled left recursion may diverge; table the expanded
arity to evaluate left-recursive grammars with SLG.

## SLG resolution

`(table 'name arity)` enables variant tabling; `(untable 'name arity)` disables it.
Both accept an optional database argument. Declarations may precede or follow
clause definitions.

```lisp
(table 'path 2)
(<-- (path ?x ?y) (path ?x ?z) (edge ?z ?y))
(<- (path ?x ?y) (edge ?x ?y))
(<-- (edge a b)) (<- (edge b c)) (<- (edge c a))
(?- (path a ?y))
;; => (((?y . b)) ((?y . c)) ((?y . a)))
```

Calls differing only in variable names share a table; variable-sharing patterns
are part of the key. Generators produce answers, while consumers suspend copied
WAM continuations and resume for new answers. Variant duplicate answers are
removed. Answer subsumption is not implemented. Answer order can differ from
ordinary depth-first execution.

A queue scheduler records positive and negative dependencies between call
variants. Iterative graph traversal computes dynamic strongly connected
components (SCCs). A component completes when its work and outgoing unfinished
dependencies are resolved. Calls to child components wait for completion;
recursive calls within the same component suspend as consumers.
Continuation copying can use substantial memory when many consumers suspend.

### Negation and truth values

`(tnot (p ...))` requires a declared tabled predicate and ground arguments when
selected. Nonground negation raises a floundering error. Negation can be delayed
and simplified as tables complete; unresolved negative cycles are undefined.

```lisp
(table 'p 0) (table 'q 0)
(<-- (p) (tnot (q)))
(<-- (q) (tnot (p)))
(query '((p)) :truth-values t)
;; => ((:truth :undefined :bindings nil :delays ((q))))
```

`query` and `?-` normally enumerate only true answers. With `:truth-values t`,
`query` returns `(:truth :true-or-undefined :bindings alist :delays goals)`.
Each delayed goal represents a negation whose truth remains unresolved.
Different conditional derivations may yield different delay lists for the same
bindings. A true derivation removes matching conditional variants. False goals
produce no answers.

`next-solution` additionally returns truth as its third value and delays as its
fourth. Its second value is T for conditional answers as well.

### Tabled grammars

```lisp
(table 'letters 2) ; A zero-argument grammar expands to arity two.
(---> (letters) (letters) '(a))
(--> (letters))
(?- (phrase (letters) (a a a))) ; => (NIL)
```

### Cuts and limitations

Ordinary choice points and completed-table answer alternatives can be pruned.
A cut crossing an unfinished tabled call raises `slg-incomplete-cut`. The check
depends on reached calls and their current SCC/completion state.

```lisp
(table 'first-path 1)
(<-- (first-path ?x) (path a ?x) !)
(?- (first-path ?x)) ; Select one answer after PATH completes.

(table 'bad 1)
(<-- (bad ?x) (bad ?x) !)
(<- (bad base))
(?- (bad ?x)) ; SLG-INCOMPLETE-CUT: crosses an unfinished recursive call.
```

A caller's cut leaves other answers in a completed child table intact.
Generator-entry and helper-local cuts are supported, as are DCG cuts and opaque
phrase boundaries. Logical cut scope identities survive continuation copying.
Illegal cuts and other execution errors abort the cursor and release partial
tables; create a new query instead of resuming that cursor.

- Tables are query-local and released on exhaustion or `close-query`.
- Lisp callbacks are unsupported inside generators and after conditional answers;
  ordinary callers receiving completed true answers may use them.
- Cyclic table keys and answers are unsupported; ordinary SLD rational trees remain supported.
- Changing clauses or declarations after tabling starts invalidates the active cursor.
- Termination requires finitely many call variants and answers, plus terminating
  untabled work; unbounded term growth is not covered.
- Nonground negation, incremental tabling, call/answer subsumption, answer
  aggregation and immediate completion from ground success are unsupported.

The implementation does not use XSB code or claim full XSB/SWI-Prolog compatibility.

## WAM execution

The sole execution backend generates granular term instructions.

| Family | Instructions |
|---|---|
| Head matching | get-variable/value/constant/list/structure |
| Body construction | put-variable/value/constant/list/structure |
| Read/write scanning | unify-variable/value/constant/void |
| Write-mode construction | set-variable/value/constant/void |
| Control | allocate, deallocate, call, execute, proceed |

A registers alias X registers. Clause variables occupy Y slots; temporary term
references use X registers. Variable cells live on the heap, so classic WAM
unsafe/local instructions for stack-variable relocation are unnecessary.
`disassemble-predicate` displays compiled instructions.

Short proper lists beginning with a symbol can use structure instructions;
long and open lists use list instructions. Both preserve native cons semantics.
The structure-recognition bound is an optimization, not a limit on term size.
This is not a contiguous classic WAM tagged-cell heap.

Prolog calls do not use Lisp recursion. Unification, compilation, term export,
graph copying and GC traversal also use explicit work lists. User callback
recursion is outside this guarantee. First-argument indexing is not implemented.

## Garbage collection and updates

VM GC tracks variable cells and VM-created cons cells. Nonmoving mark/compact
compresses ownership vectors while preserving object identity; SBCL GC performs
physical reclamation. External Lisp cons graphs are traversed but not included
in managed allocation counts.

Roots include current registers/environments, saved continuations, choice-point
arguments and environments, query variables, term scan positions and generator
answer arguments. Only necessary undo records for reachable variables survive.
Choice-point heap/trail marks are remapped after compaction. Monotonic allocation
ages preserve conditional-trailing decisions across GC.

Automatic GC runs at safe instruction boundaries. The default starting threshold
is 4,096 cells and adapts to the live set. Ownership-vector capacity also shrinks.

```lisp
(let ((cursor (make-query '((append ?xs ?ys (a b c))) :gc-threshold 64)))
  (unwind-protect
      (progn
        (next-solution cursor)
        (collect-query-garbage cursor)
        (query-statistics cursor))
    (close-query cursor)))
(query '((append ?xs ?ys (a b c))) :gc-threshold nil) ; Disable automatic VM GC.
```

GC reduces retention of dead terms; live choices, non-tail continuations and
outputs still consume memory. Collected query results and compiled code are not
part of the managed heap statistics. Exhaustion and `close-query` release VM roots.

`query-statistics` reports instruction, continuation, choice, managed-cell, trail
and GC counts. Its `:slg` field reports tables, answers, suspensions/resumptions,
copied continuations, worker instructions and component statistics. Outer-VM
heap counts are not total SLG or process memory. Active workers use VM GC;
saved continuations are retained through Lisp GC roots.

Clause updates publish immutable code snapshots. Existing calls keep their entry
alternatives; later calls see the new definitions. Builtin assert/retract uses
the same logical update view. Full static/dynamic directive classification is
not implemented.

See [Builtins](BUILTINS.md) for predicate semantics and [Validation](VALIDATION.md)
for tested behavior and limits.
