# Benchmarks

Run scripts from the repository root. The scripts remain here; recorded
measurements live under `results/` and focused experiments retain their own
directories.

| Location | Role |
|---|---|
| `run.lisp`, `summarize.lisp` | Baseline workloads and CSV summaries |
| `profile.lisp`, `diagnose.lisp` | SBCL profiling and temporary diagnostic substitutions |
| `competitive*.lisp`, `competitive*.pl`, `compare.py` | Shared Prolog workloads and SWI comparison |
| `ablate.py`, `ablations/` | Optimizer ablation driver, patches and measurements |
| `type-declarations/` | Type-declaration experiment and measurements |
| `results/baseline.*` | Baseline raw observations and summary |
| `results/diagnostics.*` | Diagnostic substitution observations and summary |
| `results/*-results.json` | Archived cross-engine measurements |
| `results/profiles/` | Recorded CPU and allocation profiles |

```sh
sbcl --dynamic-space-size 2048 --control-stack-size 1 --script benchmarks/run.lisp
sbcl --script benchmarks/summarize.lisp
python3 benchmarks/compare.py --sbcl /path/to/sbcl --swipl /path/to/swipl
```

Baseline runs default to `results/baseline.sexp`; `BENCH_RESULTS` overrides the
output path. The comparison driver defaults to `results/wam-results.json`
relative to this directory; its `--output` override is relative to the repository
root. Existing measurements retain their original bytes, versions and source
fingerprints; moving them does not constitute a new benchmark run.

See [baseline analysis](../docs/BENCHMARKS.md),
[SWI comparison](../docs/COMPETITIVE-BENCHMARKS.md) and
[historical native compiler ablation](../docs/NATIVE-ABLATION.md).
The specialization/JIT implementation has been removed. Archived native-compiler
results do not describe the current WAM interpreter; use a new output path when
measuring it. The current comparison defaults to one query per timed sample;
`BENCH_BATCH` overrides this in both engines. `ablate.py` and its patches
reproduce historical revisions only.
